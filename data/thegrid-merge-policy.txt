THEGRID Merge Policy v1.0

Goal: Safely merge Jake's Core Save with the site's latest public baseline and user membership saves.

Priority order:
1) Jake's private changes (owner: Jake, meta.owner == 'Jake')
2) New public improvements (source_site_version newer than Core Save)
3) Existing Core Save content

Per-niche merge key:
- key = normalized niche name (lowercase, hyphenated)
- If key exists in both, compare prompts by hash and timestamps:
  - If different and both changed since last sync => keep BOTH as variants:
    * keep user's as '[niche]-private'
    * keep public as '[niche]-public'
  - Else prefer the newer updated_at value.

Fields merged:
- prompt: last-writer-wins unless conflict -> two variants
- render_settings: field-by-field, prefer more specific (e.g., explicit fps over range)
- notes/history: append (do not overwrite)

Versioning:
- meta.version increments by 0.1 each merge
- meta.source_site_version set to site version we merged

Provenance:
- Add 'updated_by' and 'updated_at' on each niche after merge

Security:
- Only accept merges signed by trusted keys (Jake + site)
- Membership saves are sandboxed; cannot overwrite Jake's private entries
